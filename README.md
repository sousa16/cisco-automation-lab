# Cisco Automation Lab

Personal playground for studying and experimenting with Cisco automation concepts across:

- **DCCOR (350-601)** – Data Center Core  
- **DCCAUTO (300-635)** – Data Center Automation  
- **DEVCOR (350-901)** – DevNet Core  

This repo is focused on hands-on practice with APIs, programmability, infrastructure as code, and network automation workflows.
